# Melanoma Detection
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that -can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can -evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a -lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

-The data set contains the following diseases:

    Actinic keratosis
    Basal cell carcinoma
    Dermatofibroma
    Melanoma
    Nevus
    Pigmented benign keratosis
    Seborrheic keratosis
    Squamous cell carcinoma
    Vascular lesion

## General Information
- Melanoma skin cancer detection has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis. 
- will build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 
- The data set that is used in this project isCNN_assignment.zip

## Conclusions
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
